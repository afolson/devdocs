<h1 class="title">Services API</h1>
<p>A service is an endpoint (like Nagios, email, or an API call) that generates events, which Pagerduty normalizes and dedupes, creating <a href="incidents.html">incidents</a>.</p>
<p>When a service is shown inlined in other resources, a deleted service will have its html_url attribute set to null.</p>
<table class="table action_index"><caption>This API lets you access and manipulate the services across your account.</caption><thead><th>Resource</th><th>Description</th></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="services/list.html">GET services</a></td><td>List existing services.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="services/show.html">GET services/:id</a></td><td>Get details about an existing service.</td></tr>
